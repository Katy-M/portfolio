    aboutText: `Hello! My name is Katy Mollenkopf. I am a senior-level (fourth-year) student at Rochester Institute of Technology pursing a 
        Bachelor of Science degree in Game Design and Development. My primary skills lie in programming with C++, JavaScript, and C#, but I also have 
        experience working in Unity (both 2D and 3D) and I am currently studying Unreal Engine. While I love to code (particularly 
        for game development) I am especially drawn to game and level design â€“ working with teams of programmers, artists, 
        and other designers to turn a common vision into a memorable experience for players. I have an insatiable desire to 
        grow my skillset and learn new technologies, and I am always looking for ways to improve and connect with others. 
        Below, I have posted links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and NexusMods profiles, as well as my blog on level design, in addition to 
        a contact page and a .pdf of my resume.`,

                    practice implementing a space appropriate for radiant quests and hooking up any required functionality to do so through the editor.
                    I also experimented with optimally combining different asset kits to create an atmospheric dungeon
                    that fits well with the world. I created a five-part video series documenting my design process from the first prototype
                    to the published level. The level can be added to a Steam copy of Skyrim through the Workshop, linked below.
                    I primarily worked on this level in April 2019."

            I designed this level to practice using light in guiding the player and creating a space that provides options for different
            playstyles. I created a three-part video series documenting my process and I've included my design document as well, which
            includes my layout map. The map can be played through Far Cry 5's Arcade mode on the PC.
            Development spanned late February - March 2019."

            working with metrics and improve my skills in 3D modeling/texturing. I also aim to better understand procedural generation and
            how I can modify the algorithm to better suit different gameplay or space purposes.

            procedurally-generated maps to find two keys to escape a dangerous vault. The vault contains various hazards,
            such as traps and monsters, but there are also tools the player can find to increase their own chances of escape.
            I independently completed this long-term project to not only better my programming skills, but also to practice 
            implementing and balancing game mechanics outside of my classes. Primary development took place August 2017 - May 2018."
